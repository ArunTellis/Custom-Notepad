//        answer is simple that is the BoxWeight class is not initialising the length variable since it's a super class constructor is called it will be initialised by the constructor of the Box class.

        super(length, height, width); //this works since parent is initialised before the child
        System.out.println(super.height);
//        super will just point to the parent class just above the child class even though the object class was there since Box is above the BoxWeight class it will be accessing the Box class
//        Here even though BoxWeight is inheriting the object class why it's referencing to the Box class


//        super();// if we don't pass any parameter to the super constructor then the default constructor of the parent is called

//        we will get the following error "Call to 'super()' must be first statement in constructor body"

//        System.out.println(this.weight); // here we are calling the current class member
//        System.out.println(super.weight); // here we are explicitly calling the parent member weight
//        we could also use the super keyword to explicitly call the parent class members for example
//        If let's assume the parent class i.e, Box has also member variable called weight
//                we can call that member variable with the help of super keyword

//        System.out.println(box1.weight); we cannot access the child class methods or variables from the parent class since parent class dont have any idea about how the child class has been implemented
//        accessing of the methods and variables will happen in upward motion i.e, child class can access the parent class members if they are not private we cant do the reverse
        //calling the constructor by passing the object of the same class
        Box box2 = new Box(box1);
        System.out.println(box1.width + " " + box1.height);

        BoxWeight box3 = new BoxWeight();
        BoxWeight box4 = new BoxWeight(2, 3, 4, 8);
        System.out.println(box3.height + " " + box3.weight);


//        Box box5 = new BoxWeight(2, 3, 4, 8); //always the accessing of the thin
//        System.out.println(box5.weight); //We cannot access it we will get following error "Cannot resolve symbol 'weight'"

//The reason:- "It is the type of the reference variable  and not the type of the object which determines what members can be accessed."
// Here the reference variable type is Box whereas it is referencing to the type BoxWeight
//        so all the members that are present in the Box class can be accessed by the variable box5


//        BoxWeight box6 = new Box(2, 3, 4); //here the constructor called is of parent class so we cant initialise the weight of the BoxWeight class
//        System.out.println(box6);

//        Reason:-
//         1. there are many variables in both parent and child classes
//         2. we are given access to variables that are in the ref type i.e. BoxWeight
//         3. hence, we should have access to weight variable
//         4. this also means, that the ones we are trying to access should be initialised
//         5. but here we are calling the constructor of the parent class which means that we are unable to initialise the weight variable
//         6. because downward motion doesn't have the idea on downward classes i.e, parent class don't know
//         about the child classes so it don't know about the members of child class here it is weight


//        Box.greeting();

        BoxWeight box = new BoxWeight();
        BoxWeight.greeting(); // you can inherit but you cannot override
    }
}


//    Box obj1 = new Box();
//    lhs(reference i.e. obj1) is looked by compiler & rhs (object i.e. new Box()) is looked by jvm
// The key to Javaâ€™s safety is that you cannot manipulate references as you can actual pointers.
//        Thus, you cannot cause an object reference to point to an arbitrary memory location or manipulate it like an integer.
